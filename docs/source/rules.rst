Bowling rules
=============

Basics
------
- One game of bowling consists of 10 frames
- minimum score of zero and a maximum of 300
- Each frame consists of two chances to knock down ten pins

The Open Frame
--------------
- If, after two shots, at least one pin is still standing, it’s called an open frame
- If you don't get a strike or a spare in a frame, your score is the total number of pins you knock down.

The Strike
----------
- Knocking down all ten pins on your first ball is called a strike, denoted by an X on the score sheet.
- A strike is worth 10, plus the value of your next two rolls.
- At minimum, your score for a frame in which you throw a strike will be 10 (10+0+0).
- At best, your next two shots will be strikes, and the frame will be worth 30 (10+10+10).

The Spare
---------
- If it takes two shots to knock down all ten pins, it’s called a spare, denoted by a /.
- A spare is worth 10, plus the value of your next roll.
- The maximum score for a frame in which you get a spare is 20 (a spare followed by a strike),
- and the minimum is 10 (a spare followed by a gutter ball).

The Tenth Frame
---------------
- If you throw a strike on your first ball in the tenth frame, you need two more shots to determine the total value of the strike.
- If you throw a spare on your first two balls in the tenth frame, you need one more shot to determine the total value of the spare. This is called a fill ball.
- If you throw an open frame in the tenth frame, you won't get a third shot.
